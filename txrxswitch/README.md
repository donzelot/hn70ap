This folder contains a complete, stand-alone kicad project for a fast TX/RX switch that could be used with the main hn70ap circuit.

The design is experimental, in particular, I have no idea if isolation between the tx and rx branches is enough.

The project is released under the CERN OHL (schematic and board).
